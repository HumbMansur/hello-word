# hello-word
First repository only for testing purpose. 
I'm Humberto and I'm learning how to use GitHub. This is my first time in the website.
I'm doing that because I'm enrolled at Information System degree.
Hopefully I'll be a good programmer one day and use GitHub and similar tools professionaly or even at my own project!
